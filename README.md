This project was created through the Scrimba frontend developer path course at www.scrimba.com.

The languages used throughout this project were HTML, CSS and Javascript.

**Note: ** This was perhaps the most challenging build I completed through Scrimba but definitely the most rewarding. The heavy use of DOM for display logic and manipulation was great for understanding how to conditionally render code based on user action. All in all, this project helped me gain confidence in what I had learned through sucessfully completing the demanding challenges.

I continue to read through the code to ensure that I retain at least most of my understanding of the code.
